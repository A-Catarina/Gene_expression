# Gene_expression
This work objective was to implement a pipeline to perform differential expression analysis on transcriptomic data. 
To do so, bash scripts were developed to each of the tasks involved, namely:
  - Read Quality Control
  - Read counts
  - Correlation analysis among samples
  - Differential expression analysis

r language was also used for data manipulation and further analysis.

FASTQC, hisat and DeSeq2 were the tools employed to infer reads quality, perform mapping and differential expression analysis, respectively.
